# RSS-Feed-Reader
This is the final project in my Client/Server class.

This program uses PHP to read three RSS feeds and display them to the user.  The user can
click the title of one of the articles to go to its website.  There is a button that allows 
a user to save an article of their choice.  The article to be saved is stored in an xml file 
where it can be seen later.
